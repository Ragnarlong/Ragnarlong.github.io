# If I Had A Heart

This will never end

cause i want more

more, give me more, give me more

this will never end

cause i want more

more, give me more, give me more

if i had a heart i could love you

if i had a voice i would sing

after the night when i wake up

i'll see what tomorrow brings

if i had a voice i would sing

dangling feet from window frame

will i ever ever reach the floor?
